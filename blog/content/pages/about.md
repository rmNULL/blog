Ligλ is a portmanteau of "lig-" from latin verb *"ligāre"*(meaning "to bind"),  
And the great λ from [λ-Calculus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/#Int) to denote an anonymous function.  
Together it means "To bind an anonymous function".  
Although i don't think it makes much sense i just decided to stick with
it as i had to quickly decide on a name.
